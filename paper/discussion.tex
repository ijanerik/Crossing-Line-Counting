\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis we have shown several points. Crowd Crossing Counting is possible without the supervised knowledge of the Flow Estimation. Two new models are proposed with which the flow enhanced model outperforms the strong baseline which suggests that knowledge about the flow improves the density map prediction for moving objects.

Additionally we have shown both quantitive and qualitative that the maxing filter is an effective method to realign the flow map and the density map, which drastically increases the performance.

Lastly we did a thorough analysis on real world performance. According to the results it would be possible to run the model real time on a fast GPU without optimization. Further optimization could lead to an even quicker model.


\section{Further research}
Due to the lack of high density videos, the full potential of this network can't be shown to its full extend. For further research it would be ideal to propose such a high density map.
