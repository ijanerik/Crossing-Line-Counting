\chapter{Method}
For our system we split up the program into 3 parts. The Crowd Counting models, the Flow Estimation models and the Line of Interest. The methods which combine the Crowd Counting and the Flow Estimation in a single model are called Crowd Flow models (Useful as directory in the final code)

train.py \# Train the models (All models should be trainable in this file, because they all share the same kind of dataloader)

test.py \# Test the LOI methods using a trained network from train.py (Based on the datasets provided)

run.py \# Run from a video stream live. (Would be super cool and very useful to actual demo this thing)
