\subsubsection{ArenaPeds}
For this thesis we have access to a dataset of the City of Amsterdam. It has xxx amount of footage of environments with crowds ranging from 10 pedestrians in the frame to 1000 pedestrians a few hours later. Only a tiny proportion is labeled with where each pedestrian is. So there is no labeled data on the Crowd Direction, only for the Crowd Counting. This is the reason why we want to try to give unsupervised learning a shot.
