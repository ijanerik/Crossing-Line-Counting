## Planning
- Start writing method
- Continue to getting to work the Flow Estimator DDFlow (PWC-Net underneath)
- Try to create of all the papers in the overview a good summary (Flow Estimation/LOI)
- How combining the velocities and and the crowd counting

- On paper what to talk about with Zenglin


## Directions on which we can improve: (Subquestions)
- Now we pick DDFlow, but are there any other unsupervised methods.
- Which Flow Estimator method is best? FlowNet/PWC-Net? (And how about traditional methods??)
- Maybe a good idea is to shape the Gaussian differently
- Maybe something like finding a way to make the direction under a certain Gaussian more similar/smooth
